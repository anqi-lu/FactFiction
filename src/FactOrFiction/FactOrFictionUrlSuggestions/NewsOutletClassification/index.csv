http://nap-sack.org/,MIXED,Left Bias,Nap-Sack bills itself as an alternative social media site open to the world at large to voice their opinions on anything; social and political issues; science; spiritualism; etc. In this it largely succeeds as there are numerous options for visitors to start petitions; comment on the blogs and start or join discussion groups. The blogs on the site were a mixed bag; running the gamut from left bias political commentary; to UFOs; to spirituality. Other than the blog commentary; Nap-Sack is a-political as it encourages visitors to speak their mind regardless of their political and social views. They also offer links to a variety of news sources from Russia Today to Reuters. Nap-Sack; as it is a social media site and doesnt pretend to be anything else; does not easily fit in any of the usual MBFC categories. It is Pro-Science in some regards; Conspiracy-Pseudoscience in others; and somewhat Questionable as well. It earned a Left Bias strictly from the political content of the blogs.

The ACLU in their blog section and even news section often cite to places like the Huffington Post for news articles but sometimes they will usebasic reporting like AP or Reuters. Beyond their news and blog posts most of the site covers issues that are often considered more liberal causes but most often it is consistent with theirstance on the rights they champion. TheACLU has defended the KKK; Pro Abortion; and Neo-Nazis right to assemble and protest (1 2 3). They will often be accused of being left biased as they do not advocate for gun rights; however they equally do not champion gun regulations either. A quick search for Gun Rights or even Guns will yield no results or results only related to search and seizure cases they have taken on. They do not agree on the individuals rights to own firearms but do not advocate on their beliefs. They have teamed up with the NRA several times in a sort of odd fellowship (4). Their Blog & News feeds can often be filled with more left leaning stances; but they are not biased in their case work load or defending the rights they advocate for. There have been times Justice Scalia the most outspoken and most conservative justice at the time had ideas that line up with the ACLU (5). Most modern conservatives may often take issue with much of what the ACLU advocates and litigates in courts. However; the ACLU has defended religious freedoms in the school as well. Including the right to pray in school (6). I would try to advocate that the ACLU is more neutral than left; but with the major shift in American politics to the right; I can no longer advocate that stance. (M. Allen 2/9/2017)

http://www.attn.com/,HIGH,Left-Center Bias,ATTN is a political and social site geared towards millennials; although not exclusively so. Founded by Matthew Segal; a political activist and commentator who writes for the Huffington Post and is also a frequent commentator on MSNBC. While Mr. Segals politics are unashamedly left leaning; the content of ATTN is factual and well sourced. The political tone of the articles is mixed; running from Left Bias to Least Biased. While this reflects the individual authors opinions more than any specific editorial stance this slight lack of focus in overall content is what prevented ATTN from receiving a Least Biased rating. Additionally; ATTN does cite itself occasionally in its other articles; which I find a bit self serving when any news site does it. Even if the content cited is factual. While again; this may reflect the individual authors rather than editorial intent; its easy enough to use external sources instead. That said; the quality of the content on the site is very high; and except for a slight caveat on the bias and self sourcing; I wouldnt hesitate to recommend ATTN to anyone looking for a solid news source.

http://21stcenturywire.com/,MIXED,Conspiracy-Pseudoscience,21st Century Wire is an alternative news website that rejects the consensus of science regarding climate changeand also promotes the conspiracy that mainstream media is publishing fake news. This source has also receivedan unproven claim by Snopes; which 21st Century Wire considers a questionable source. The website Fort Liberty has placed 21st Century Wire on its Fake News/Hoax list. I disagree with Fort Liberty that 21st Century is a publisher of fake news. 21st Century employs somewhat sensational headlines and does provide sourcing to attempt to support claims. The primary issue is that 21st Century publishes some questionable stories (see examples above) that are embedded among legitimate stories they publish. This can mislead the reader. (D.

What sets NB apart from other sites of this type is that the stories are; for the most part; well written and contain numerous sources. The bias of the writing is also more subtle than sites such as Infowars; but just as prevalent. Both as an overtone to all the stories as well as the sometimes questionable sources and / or the conclusions drawn from the source material. Additionally; many of their sources are other NB stories; or work the author and editors have done elsewhere.

They have published a rather large list of media outlets that are either directly working for the Russians or unknowingly spreading Russian propaganda. This source also does not give details about who they are as they fear retaliation from the Russians. Seriously; they said this. Some of the sources listed as Russian Propagandist are simply ridiculous as they have zero to do with politics.

https://www.avoiceformen.com/,N/A,Questionable Sources,A Voice for Men (AVFM) is a mens human right advocacy site run by Paul Elam; the titular leader of the mens rights movement in America.

There is very little external sourcing for any of the content; and what source links I did follow led only to other anti-feminism opinion pieces and sites. The content is heavily weighted against feminism; and much of it revolves around the usual mens rights issues. Divorce; custody; child support; mens reproductive rights; etc. The site earns a Questionable rating based on the extreme bias of its mens rights advocacy. (D. Kelley 3/4/2017)
