Founded by Matthew Segal; a political activist and commentator who writes for the Huffington Post and is also a frequent commentator on MSNBC. While Mr. Segals politics are unashamedly left leaning; the content of ATTN is factual and well sourced. The political tone of the articles is mixed; running from Left Bias to Least Biased. While this reflects the individual authors opinions more than any specific editorial stance this slight lack of focus in overall content is what prevented ATTN from receiving a Least Biased rating. Additionally; ATTN does cite itself occasionally in its other articles; which I find a bit self serving when any news site does it. Even if the content cited is factual. While again; this may reflect the individual authors rather than editorial intent; its easy enough to use external sources instead. That said; the quality of the content on the site is very high; and except for a slight caveat on the bias and self sourcing; I wouldnt hesitate to recommend ATTN to anyone looking for a solid news source.
